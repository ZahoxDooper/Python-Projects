# Python-Projects
My beginner Python projects for engineering practice.
Ohm's law calculator: Made this project to calculate Voltage, current, and resistance based on the user's input. The user chooses which value to find (V/I/R), and the program computes it automatically.
Also I used input() to get values from the user, if/elif/else statements to handle which value to calculate, and basic arithmetic operations to perform the calculations. I also added a check to prevent division by zero, which was a nice touch, I am proud of.
Through this project, I learned how to handle user input, implement conditional logic, and apply Python programming to solve real-world engineering problems.
2. Made a simple python program that converts between certain units, like the previous one. This program askes the user which type of conversion they want.The user enters the value and the units. finally, The program outputs the converted value.
What i have learned: improved my knowledge of if/else/elif and strucuting the code so it can handle multiple options


3.Made a Python program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and calculates useful statistics. It took me about an hour to make, as I needed to learn many different commands and codes, Especially what the functions even do for example: loops, lists, and f-strings.
